## what is adcirpolate ?
*adcirpolate* is a module for interpolating hotstart files between different ADCIRC meshes.
Hence, we can switch between different meshes to avoid unnecessary computation on meshes with
high resolution in areas where no important phenomenon is going on. If you do not know about
ADCIRC, or its hotstart files, you are in the wrong place !
